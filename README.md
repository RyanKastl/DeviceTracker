# WatchYourBack2.0
Device Tracker is a locally run server that can manage multiple Raspberry Pi's that track a device's location through an intuitive front-end.

This is the next level of security for the modern world. The basis of this product is to know where your device is at all times without having to rely on other companies to track for you. Have you ever lost your phone? I have - alot. And when it dies? You're out of luck. But with WatchYourBack2.0, your own server will know where your device is at all times. 

Background:

The device was created to be able to find someone's device on campus - but that was just too creepy. So plot twist -  we made created a device that does something very similar but a little different. We set up clients at all the locations that would be useful - your office, headquarters, man cave, wherever you want basically and itll ping you whenever the device enters the area. It does this by parsing all the packets leaving these locations routers looking for your own device. When your device enters - ping your in. 

This application comes with its very own front end that'll keep track of your device at all times and let you know where it is. This device could be turned into a state of the art tracker to find whatever device you need.
